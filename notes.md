#Automa-te Notes

Pen starts at the top-right of the drawing area.

##Three disc layers from top to bottom are for:

- Wrist throw (lift/drop pen)
- Y axis (draw down)
- X axis (draw left)

##Default positions for each disc layer head:

- Wrist : 30mm from center
- X : 13mm from center
- Y : 13mm from center

##Maximum throw distance for each layer head:

- Wrist : 11mm
- X : 25mm
- Y : 26mm


##Other measurements:

- One full disc rotation is about 35.7 seconds (kinda close to 10 degrees per second)
- Inner disc square: 12.75mm
- Writing area is about 38mm x 28mm (remeasure)
- Maximum disc radius looks about 38mm (top-most disc)
- Minimum disc radius looks about 12mm (bottom-most disc)
- Disc thickness is 2mm

## Random thoughts

- You can move rapidly from left to right or bottom to top by introducing a sheer cliff and letting the spring snap back. This might be handy for kind of compressing a rapid movement.
